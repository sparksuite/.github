# Hi, weâ€™re Sparksuite ðŸ‘‹

Weâ€™re a small team with a relentless focus on mighty fine software. Day-to-day weâ€™re building industry-leading software companies like [HOA Express](https://www.hoa-express.com/) and [GradePro](https://gradepro.app/). These companies wouldnâ€™t be what they are today without the myriad of open source libraries, tools, and technologies they rely on. To give back, weâ€™ve open sourced a number of tools that solve problems our own engineers have run into.

## ðŸ˜ƒ Company culture

Software isnâ€™t our only passionâ€”weâ€™re passionate about company culture too! Over the last decade-plus, weâ€™ve built a culture and environment thatâ€™s designed to foster the best in our team. The people who make up the Sparksuite family are our greatest resource, so we treat them that way. And thatâ€™s not just talkâ€”see our [open salary calculator](https://salaries.sparksuite.com/) and [transparent employee handbook](https://handbook.sparksuite.com/), both of which are open sourced on GitHub.

Curious for more? We also post about what life is like in the Sparksuite family on our company [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/sparksuitehq/).
